![SONA header](https://stateofthenation.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sona_banner-2.jpeg)

_**1. Give 2-4 key points from the SONA 2025 that you found interesting.**_
* **Rice** will only cost **₱20 per kilo** in Kadiwa stores
* All **public schools** will have **internet** by end of 2025
* **Free rides on the "Love Bus"** will be available in some cities


_**2. Give 1-3 key points from SONA 2025 that you found weird for any reason.**_
* The government promised **₱20 rice**, but some **farmers are unhappy** because they earn less.
* The president said every town now has a doctor, but **some places still do not have enough healthcare**

_**3. Write 2 paragraphs of reflection.**_
> I think President Marcos has **many good plans**, like making rice cheaper and giving free healthcare to people. These ideas can help families save money and live better lives. I also like that he wants to give teachers laptops and internet to schools because it will make learning easier for children and students like me.

> However, I feel like **some promises might be hard to keep**, like making sure all towns have doctors or fixing all water problems. It's important that the government listens to people, especially farmers, to make sure everyone is happy. I hope these plans really happen and help everyone in the country.

_**4. What 1 word/ phrase/ or sentence do you have for the Philippines after hearing SONA 2025?**_
>**Hopeful.**
